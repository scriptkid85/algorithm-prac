1) For the addition problem. remember algorithm cannot stop if there is a carry-on even if no arguments.

2) For list problem, the slow runner and fast runner can be used for many subproblems:
   (1) collision detection
   (2) length control (slower one will reach the middle when 2*faster one reach the end)
   (3) find the start point of the loop in the list
