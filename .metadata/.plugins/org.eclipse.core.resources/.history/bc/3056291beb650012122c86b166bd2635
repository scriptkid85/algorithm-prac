(3) how to count the trailing zeros of the n factorial?
    (a) Find out the n factorial first and then count the number of trailing zeros.
    	but due to the int bit size, n cannot be too large.
    	
    VERY GOOD!!! also a good method to find number of certain divisor
    (b) All the trailing zeros coming from 2 * 5; since there are so many 2s. We just need to count the number of divisors '5'.
    	first count every 5 numbers, then 25 numbers...., then 125 numbers
    	 
    	 1 2 ...... 5 .. 10 .. 15 ... 20 ....25 ....30 ... 35 ....40 ...45 .... 50
   count            1     1     1      1      1      1      1      1     1       1
                                              1    	                             1
