Bit manipulation trick:

(1)
	/2 >= 1 to find binary representation for int > 1
	*2 >= 1 to find binary representation for int < 1

(5)
	a easy way to remove the last 1 in a number:a & (a - 1)
	this can be used to count 1s of a:
	for(a; a != 0; a = a & (a - 1))cnt ++;
	
(6)
	use mask (e.g. 0x55555555) to take more than one bits of a number once.
	
!!!(3)!!!
	remember what is the next largest value and next smallest value for a given number (with the same 1s and 0s)
	
	
(7) is hard!!! Need to think about the whole process carefully
