Testing a real world object:

1)who will use it and why? Identify user groups first.

2)What are the use cases? Identify how will these user groups use it.

3)What are the bounds of use? (Extreme case of usage, using environment: should it still work in these cases? how?)

4)What are the stress/ failure conditions? 

5)How can you test it? (Improving the testing speed, testing duration under "normal" usage, etc.)

Testing a software:

1) Are we doing BlackBox tesing or White Box tesing?

2) Users? Why?

3) Use cases?

4) Bounds of usage?

5) Stress/ failure condition?

6) How to do the test?


Troubleshooting questions:

1) understand the scenario: 
	how long has the user experienced the issue?
	what version? OS? error report?
	
2) break down the problem:
	image the work flow of the issue and make every step clear
	
3) create specific, managable tests
