(2) For some special sorting problem which has a special ordering rule, changing the comparator
	is a good way to solve it.
	
	note !!!!: for "sort" function, the comparator(i ,j) function is a bool and return true
	if i < j, otherwise return false.
	
	
(4) details of "!external sort!"


(6) Search in sorted matrix (row sorted and column sorted)
	Binary on the diagonal and find the first element which greater than target,
	then the left top part and right low part has been eliminated.
	Then recursively search the left low and right top parts!!!
