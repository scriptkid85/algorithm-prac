(3) how to count the trailing zeros of the n factorial?
    (a) Find out the n factorial first and then count the number of trailing zeros.
    	but due to the int bit size, n cannot be too large.
    	
    (b) All the trailing zeros coming from 2 * 5; since there are so many 2s. We just need to count the number of divisors '5'.
    	first count
    	 
    	 1 2 ...... 5 .. 10 .. 15 ... 20 ....25
