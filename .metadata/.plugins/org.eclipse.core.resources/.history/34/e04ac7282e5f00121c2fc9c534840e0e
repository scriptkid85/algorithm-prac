(5) A easy way to test a tree to be a BST or not:
    in-order traverse, check the elements visited are non decreasing!
    
    
(6) How to find the next element of target element in the in-order traverse.
   
    if(target->right != 0)return the leftmost children of target-> right;
    while(target != target -> parent-> left && target -> parent != 0){
    	target = target -> parent;
    }
    if(target -> parent = 0) return 0;
    return target -> parent;
