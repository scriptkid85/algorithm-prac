virtual function:

if the destructor function is a virtual function, 
say Person class has virtual ~Person. Student:Person has ~Student. Then if Student(or Person) *p = new Student(); delete p;
the compiler will call ~Student first and then ~Person to make sure delete the memory for student and person


default values:
int func(int a, int b = 3) Note: all default values must be on the right side of the function declarations.
