Testing a real world object:

1)who will use it and why? Identify user groups first.

2)What are the use cases? Identify how will these user groups use it.

3)What are the bounds of use? (Extreme case of usage, using environment: should it still work in these cases? how?)

4)What are the stress/ failure conditions? 

5)How can you test it? (Improving the testing speed, testing duration under "normal" usage, etc)
